# SUPeSPAN-Analysis-Plotting-Pipeline
SUPeSPAN Analysis is an R script for integrated analysis of strand-specific DNA replication. It combines supernatant sequencing (SUP) with IP-based eSPAN, processing Input, BrdU, ChIP, eSPAN, and SUP datasets to generate strand-specific coverage, peak analysis, and replication profiles with minimal user setup.
